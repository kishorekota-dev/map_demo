## 🎯 Functionality Overlap Analysis

### poc-backend vs poc-chat-backend

**Finding**: ~70% functionality overlap detected

**Recommendation**: 
- **poc-chat-backend** is the modern, feature-complete service with WebSocket support and agent orchestration
- **poc-backend** can be deprecated or refactored to be a simple REST API facade
- For new features, use poc-chat-backend

**Current Architecture**: Both services can coexist:
- poc-chat-backend: Real-time chat, WebSocket, agent orchestration
- poc-backend: Legacy REST API support (if needed)
