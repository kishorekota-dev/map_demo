# API Implementation Progress Report
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Service:** POC Banking Service  
**Status:** In Progress

## Summary
Successfully implemented all major controller functionality and enabled banking routes. Currently resolving route configuration mismatches between route definitions and controller method names.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Controller Implementations
All controller methods have been implemented with full database integration:

#### **Accounts Controller** ✓
- `getAllAccounts()` - Get user's accounts with pagination
- `getAccountById()` - Get specific account details
- `createAccount()` - Create new account
- `updateAccount()` - Update account settings
- `closeAccount()` - Close account (with balance check)
- `getAccountBalance()` - Get current balance
- `getAccountTransactions()` - Get transaction history
- `getAccountStatements()` - Generate statements
- **`freezeAccount()`** - NEW: Freeze account (admin only)
- **`unfreezeAccount()`** - NEW: Unfreeze account (admin only)
- **`getAccountActivity()`** - NEW: Get recent activity with statistics

#### **Transactions Controller** ✓
- `getAllTransactions()` - Get all user transactions
- `getTransactionById()` - Get specific transaction
- `createTransaction()` - Create new transaction with balance update
- `cancelTransaction()` - Cancel pending transaction
- `getPendingTransactions()` - Get all pending transactions
- `searchTransactions()` - Advanced search with filters
- `getTransactionSummary()` - Get transaction statistics
- `generateReceipt()` - Generate transaction receipt
- `getCategories()` - Get available transaction categories

#### **Cards Controller** ✓
- `getAllCards()` - Get user's cards (with data masking)
- `getCardById()` - Get specific card details
- `createCard()` - Issue new card
- `updateCard()` - Update card settings
- `blockCard()` - Block card with reason
- `activateCard()` - Activate/unblock card
- `replaceCard()` - Replace lost/stolen card

#### **Transfers Controller** ✓
- `getAllTransfers()` - Get user's transfers
- `getTransferById()` - Get specific transfer
- `createTransfer()` - Initiate transfer
- `processTransfer()` - Process transfer (atomic operation)
- `cancelTransfer()` - Cancel pending transfer

#### **Fraud Controller** ✓
All fraud detection and management methods implemented (verified in earlier context)

#### **Disputes Controller** ✓
All dispute management methods implemented (verified in earlier context)

### 2. Route Registration ✓
- Uncommented all banking routes in `server.js`:
  - `/api/v1/auth` - Authentication (already working)
  - `/api/v1/accounts` - Account management
  - `/api/v1/transactions` - Transaction operations
  - `/api/v1/cards` - Card management
  - `/api/v1/transfers` - Transfer operations
  - `/api/v1/fraud` - Fraud alerts
  - `/api/v1/disputes` - Dispute management

### 3. Test Suite Creation ✓
Created comprehensive `test-api.sh` with 23+ test cases:
- Service health check
- Authentication tests (login, profile, invalid credentials)
- Account CRUD operations
- Transaction queries and operations
- Card management
- Transfer operations
- Fraud alert retrieval
- Dispute management
- RBAC/authorization tests

### 4. Database Integration ✓
All controllers use proper repositories:
- `AccountRepository` - 15+ methods
- `TransactionRepository` - 12+ methods with search/filtering
- `CardRepository` - 10+ methods with security
- `TransferRepository` - Atomic transfers with transaction support
- `FraudRepository` - Alert management
- `DisputeRepository` - Dispute lifecycle

## ⏳ In Progress

### Route Configuration Fixes
**Issue:** Some route files reference controller methods that don't exist or have different names.

**Progress:**
- ✅ Fixed `transactions.js` - Commented out unimplemented methods:
  - `updateTransactionCategory`
  - `processBulkTransactions`
  - `exportTransactions`
- ✅ Fixed `cards.js` - Mapped `unblockCard` → `activateCard`, commented out:
  - `getCardTransactions`
  - `cancelCard`
  - `getCardLimits` / `updateCardLimits`
  - `changeCardPin`
  - `getCardStatements`
- ⏳ Need to fix `transfers.js` (line 49 error)
- ⏳ Need to fix `fraud.js` (if errors)
- ⏳ Need to fix `disputes.js` (if errors)

**Current Service Load Status:**
```
✓ Database module loaded
✓ Auth routes loaded
✓ Account routes loaded
✓ Transaction routes loaded
✓ Card routes loaded
✗ Transfer routes loading... (error at line 49)
⏳ Fraud routes (pending)
⏳ Dispute routes (pending)
```

## 📊 Test Data Available
- **Users:** 15 (including admin, manager, customers)
- **Accounts:** 10 (checking, savings, credit, investment)
- **Transactions:** 20+ (various types and statuses)
- **Cards:** 9 (active, blocked, various types)
- **Transfers:** 9 (completed, pending, failed)
- **Fraud Alerts:** 6 (various severity levels)
- **Disputes:** 6 (various statuses and resolutions)

## 🔐 Authentication Working
- Admin credentials: `admin` / `Password123!`
- Returns JWT access token + refresh token
- RBAC with 45 permissions
- Token verified working for API calls

## 📁 Files Modified
1. `/poc-banking-service/controllers/accounts.js` - Added 3 methods
2. `/poc-banking-service/server.js` - Enabled all routes
3. `/poc-banking-service/routes/transactions.js` - Fixed method references
4. `/poc-banking-service/routes/cards.js` - Fixed method references
5. `/poc-banking-service/test-api.sh` - NEW: Comprehensive test suite

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Fix remaining route configuration issues (transfers, fraud, disputes)
2. Rebuild Docker container with all fixes
3. Run comprehensive test suite (`./test-api.sh`)
4. Document any failing tests
5. Implement missing controller methods if needed
6. Validate API spec alignment with database schema

## 📝 Notes
- All controllers use proper error handling with try/catch
- Database queries use parameterized statements (SQL injection safe)
- Sensitive data (card numbers, CVV) properly masked in responses
- Transaction operations are atomic where needed
- Authentication middleware applied to all banking routes
- Rate limiting configured for all endpoints

## 🚀 Deployment Status
- Service: Running on port 3005
- Database: PostgreSQL 15 (healthy)
- Container: `poc-banking-service` (requires rebuild for latest changes)
- Network: `poc-banking-network`

**Progress:** ~85% Complete
**Estimated Time to Completion:** 15-20 minutes (fix remaining routes + testing)
