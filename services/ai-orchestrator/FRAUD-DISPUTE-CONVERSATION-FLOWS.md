## Multi-Turn Conversations

### Example: Complete Fraud Report

      And do you still have your physical card?"

Turn 3 - Assess & Act:
User: "Just now. Yes, I have my card with me."
Bot: "🚨 Creating fraud alert now. Since you have your card, this is likely 
      card-not-present fraud (online/phone purchases).

      ✓ Card marked for monitoring
      ✓ Transactions flagged ($400 total)

      • Never received product/service?
      • Duplicate charge?
      • Something else?"

Turn 2 - Categorize:
User: "I ordered a laptop but it arrived damaged"
Bot: "I'm sorry to hear that. This is a 'defective product' dispute.
      
      To help your case:
      • Do you have photos of the damage?
      • Did you contact the merchant first?
      • What was their response?
      • Do you still have the packaging?"

Turn 3 - Collect Evidence:
User: "Yes I have photos. Merchant said contact manufacturer, but it arrived 
      damaged so that's not my problem."
Bot: "You're absolutely right. Let me get a few more details:
      • What was the purchase amount?
      • When was it delivered?
      • What's the merchant name?"

Turn 4 - Create Dispute:
User: "$1,200. Delivered last week from TechStore"

2. **Evidence Guidance**: Tell users what helps their case
3. **Timeline Communication**: Always set expectations
4. **Case Numbers**: Always provide for tracking
5. **Next Steps**: Always clear what happens next
6. **Empathy**: Fraud is stressful, be supportive
7. **Zero Liability**: Reassure users about protection
8. **Follow-up**: Offer to help with related actions
