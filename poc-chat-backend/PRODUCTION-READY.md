## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment

```bash
# 1. Review configuration
cat .env.production

# 2. Generate secrets
openssl rand -base64 64  # For JWT_SECRET

# 3. Test Docker build
docker-compose build

# 4. Run security scan
docker scan poc-chat-backend:latest
```

### 2. Initial Deployment

```bash
# 1. Copy environment file
cp .env.production .env

# 2. Edit with production values
vi .env

# 3. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Check health
curl http://localhost:3006/health

# 5. Verify database connection
docker-compose exec chat-backend node -e "require('./database').authenticate()"

# 6. Check logs
docker-compose logs -f chat-backend
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3006/health

# API check
curl http://localhost:3006/api

# Metrics check
curl http://localhost:3006/api/metrics

# Database check
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d poc_banking -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chat_sessions;"

# Redis check
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping

# WebSocket check (using wscat or your frontend)
# Connect to ws://your-domain:3006/socket.io
```

### 4. Monitoring Setup

```bash
# Set up log monitoring
docker-compose logs -f chat-backend | grep ERROR

# Monitor resources
docker stats poc-chat-backend

# Watch health endpoint
watch -n 30 'curl -s http://localhost:3006/health | jq'
```

## üîç Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor TODOs Found
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è `/routes/auth.js` - Line 23: Implement actual credential validation
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è `/services/socketHandler.js` - Line 166: Implement actual authentication logic

**Impact**: Currently using mock authentication. Should integrate with actual user service.

**Workaround**: JWT tokens are validated, but user credential checking is simplified.

**Fix Required**: Before production, implement proper authentication against user database or service.

### Recommendations

1. **Authentication Service Integration**
   - Integrate with proper user authentication service
   - Implement password hashing verification
   - Add OAuth/SSO support if needed

2. **Service Discovery**
   - Consider implementing service discovery (Consul, Eureka)
   - Use environment-based configuration as fallback

3. **Observability**
   - Add distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)
   - Implement metrics export (Prometheus)
   - Set up APM tool (New Relic, DataDog)

4. **High Availability**
   - Deploy multiple instances behind load balancer
   - Implement session stickiness for WebSockets
   - Set up database replication
   - Configure Redis Sentinel or Cluster

5. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Automated database backups
   - Tested restore procedures
   - Disaster recovery plan
   - Regular backup verification
