## ⚠️ Known Behaviors

### 1. Admin User Data Access
**Behavior**: Admin user sees limited data in some endpoints
**Reason**: Current implementation filters by user_id
**Impact**: 
- Admin can see ALL transactions (59)
- Admin sees only THEIR accounts (2)
- Admin sees only THEIR cards (2)
- Admin sees only THEIR transfers
- Admin sees only THEIR fraud alerts
- Admin sees only THEIR disputes

**Recommendation**: Implement admin bypass logic in controllers for full visibility

### 2. Data Ownership
**Current State**: Data is properly segregated by user
**Security**: ✅ Working as designed
**RBAC**: ✅ Enforced correctly
**Testing**: Use specific user credentials to test user-scoped data

### 3. Transaction Visibility
**Admin Advantage**: Transactions endpoint shows ALL data
**Why**: Likely has different filtering logic
**Result**: Admin can see all 59 transactions
