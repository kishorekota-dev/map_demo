# Frontend Error Fixes Summary

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Router Future Flag Warnings ✅

**Problem:**
- React Router v6 was showing deprecation warnings about upcoming v7 changes
- Two warnings: `v7_startTransition` and `v7_relativeSplatPath`

**Solution:**
- Added future flags to `BrowserRouter` in `src/App.tsx`
- This opts-in to v7 behavior early and suppresses the warnings

**Files Changed:**
- `src/App.tsx`

```tsx
<BrowserRouter
  future={{
    v7_startTransition: true,
    v7_relativeSplatPath: true,
  }}
>
```

### 2. Undefined userId API Errors ✅

**Problem:**
- API calls were failing with `userId: undefined`
- Error: `GET /api/users/undefined/sessions?type=unresolved&limit=10`
- User profile not being properly checked before making API calls

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `ProtectedRoute` component to properly check user authentication
- Updated `useChat` hook to validate `user.userId` before making API calls
- Changed dependency array to watch `user?.userId` instead of just `user`
- Added early return with warning when userId is missing

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
  - Added `useEffect` for proper auth check on mount
  - Added check for both `isAuthenticated` and `user` before rendering children
  
- `src/hooks/useChat.tsx`
  - Changed condition from `if (!user)` to `if (!user?.userId)`
  - Added console warning when userId is undefined
  - Updated dependency arrays to use `user?.userId`
  - Added explicit error for sendMessage when userId is missing

### 3. Connection Reset Errors ✅

**Problem:**
- `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` errors when backend not responding properly
- No user-friendly error handling
- Uncaught promise rejections in ChatContainer

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive error handling in `ChatPage`
- Wrapped all async operations with try-catch blocks
- Added Toast notifications for user feedback
- Added authentication error screen when user profile is invalid

**Files Changed:**
- `src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`
  - Added error state management
  - Created wrapper functions for all async operations
  - Added error boundary UI for missing userId
  - Integrated Toast component for error notifications
  
- `src/pages/ChatPage.css`
  - Added styles for error state display

### 4. Better Error Messages and User Feedback ✅

**Features Added:**
- Toast notifications for all operation failures
- Specific error messages for each operation:
  - Message sending failures
  - Session resume failures
  - Session creation failures
  - Session management failures
- Authentication error screen with clear instructions
- Graceful degradation when user is not properly authenticated

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test React Router Warnings:**
   - Open browser console
   - Verify no React Router deprecation warnings appear

2. **Test Authentication Flow:**
   - Clear localStorage
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Verify user profile is loaded correctly
   - Check that userId is present in API calls

3. **Test Error Handling:**
   - Disconnect backend service
   - Try sending a message
   - Verify Toast notification appears
   - Verify user-friendly error message is shown

4. **Test Session Management:**
   - Create a new session
   - Resume an existing session
   - End a session
   - Verify all operations show appropriate feedback

## Files Modified

```
src/
  App.tsx                               # Added React Router future flags
  components/
    ProtectedRoute.tsx                  # Enhanced auth checking
  hooks/
    useChat.tsx                         # Added userId validation
  pages/
    ChatPage.tsx                        # Added error handling
    ChatPage.css                        # Added error state styles
```

## Backend Requirements

Ensure the following backend services are running:
- Chat Backend: `http://localhost:3006` (VITE_CHAT_BACKEND_URL)
- Banking Service: `http://localhost:3005/api/v1` (VITE_BANKING_SERVICE_URL)

## Environment Variables

Required `.env` configuration:
```properties
VITE_CHAT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3006
VITE_BANKING_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3005/api/v1
VITE_APP_NAME=Banking Chatbot POC
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly
2. Monitor for any remaining console errors
3. Consider adding retry logic for failed API calls
4. Add loading states for better UX during operations
5. Consider implementing a global error boundary component

## Notes

- All TypeScript errors have been resolved
- Code follows existing project patterns and conventions
- Error handling is consistent across the application
- User feedback is clear and actionable
