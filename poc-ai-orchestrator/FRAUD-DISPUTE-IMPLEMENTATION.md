# Fraud Case and Dispute Management - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced fraud case management and dispute resolution capabilities implemented in the AI Orchestrator, aligned with the Banking Service API specifications.

## New Intent Prompts

### 1. Enhanced Dispute Transaction Intent

**Intent**: `dispute_transaction`

**Purpose**: File a comprehensive dispute/chargeback case with proper categorization and evidence collection.

**Enhanced Features**:
- ‚úÖ 10 dispute types supported (unauthorized, incorrect amount, service issues, fraud, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Evidence collection guidance
- ‚úÖ Case number generation and tracking
- ‚úÖ Expected timeline communication (30-45 days)

- `amountDisputed`: Amount in question
- `merchantName`: Merchant involved

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: "I need to dispute transaction TXN-12345. I was charged $150 but only received $100 in service."

Bot: "I'll help you file a dispute for transaction TXN-12345.

This appears to be an 'incorrect_amount' dispute.

To strengthen your case, do you have any of the following evidence?
- Receipt showing the agreed amount
- Email confirmations
- Photos or screenshots
- Service agreement

Please provide any additional details about what happened."

User: "Yes, I have an email confirmation showing $100 was the agreed price."

Amount Disputed: $50 (difference between $150 charged and $100 agreed)
Expected Timeline: 30-45 days
Status: Under Review

Next Steps:
1. We'll contact the merchant within 3 business days
2. Merchant has 10 days to respond
3. We'll review all evidence and make a determination

You're protected under our Zero Liability policy - you won't be responsible for fraudulent charges.

Would you like me to block your card permanently and order a replacement?"
```

### 3. Check Fraud Alerts Intent

   Amount: $500.00

   ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION NEEDED: Please verify if this was you.

```

### 4. Verify Transaction Intent

**Intent**: `verify_transaction`

**Purpose**: Respond to fraud alerts by confirming if activity was legitimate.

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ View flagged transaction details
- ‚úÖ Simple yes/no verification
- ‚úÖ Automatic false positive marking
- ‚úÖ Automatic fraud escalation if confirmed

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: "I need to verify alert FA-202510-876543"

Bot: "Alert #FA-202510-876543 Details:

Transaction: $150.00 at Amazon.com
Date: Oct 8, 2025, 3:45 PM
Location: Seattle, WA
Device: iPhone (new device)
IP Address: 192.168.1.100

This was flagged because:

Did you authorize this transaction? (Yes/No)"

User: "Yes, that was me. I got a new phone."

## Workflow Integration

### Intent Mapping
```javascript
// In intentPrompts.js
{
  'report_fraud': {
    tools: ['banking_create_fraud_alert', 'banking_get_transactions', 'banking_block_card'],
    needsConfirmation: false  // Urgent!
  },
  'check_fraud_alerts': {
    tools: ['banking_get_fraud_alerts', 'banking_get_fraud_alert_details']
  },
  'verify_transaction': {
    tools: ['banking_get_fraud_alert_details', 'banking_verify_transaction', 'banking_confirm_fraud']

3. **Zero Liability protection** - Communicate to users
4. **24-hour response time** - Fraud team investigates quickly

### Dispute Filing
1. **Evidence collection** - Guide users on what strengthens case
2. **Case number generation** - Unique tracking number
3. **Timeline communication** - 30-45 days for resolution
4. **Merchant rights** - 10 days to respond
5. **User protection** - Fair resolution process

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Report Unauthorized Transaction
```javascript
POST /api/orchestrator/process
{
  "sessionId": "sess-123",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "intent": "report_fraud",
  "question": "Someone charged $800 to my card and it wasn't me!"
}

Expected Flow:
1. Identify fraud type: unauthorized_transaction
2. Assess severity: HIGH
3. Create fraud alert
4. Block card
5. Provide alert ID and next steps
6. Offer replacement card
```

### Scenario 2: File Dispute with Evidence
```javascript
POST /api/orchestrator/process
{
  "sessionId": "sess-124",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "intent": "dispute_transaction",
  "question": "I want to dispute TXN-999. I paid $200 but product never arrived."
}

Expected Flow:
1. Collect transaction ID: TXN-999
2. Determine dispute type: product_not_received
3. Ask for evidence (tracking number, emails)
4. Create dispute case
5. Generate case number
6. Explain timeline and next steps
```

### Scenario 3: Verify Suspicious Activity
```javascript
POST /api/orchestrator/process
{
  "sessionId": "sess-125",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "intent": "verify_transaction",
  "question": "I got an alert about a $300 charge. That was me."
}

Expected Flow:
1. Retrieve fraud alert details
2. Show transaction details
3. User confirms legitimate: "yes"
4. Mark as false positive
5. Remove any restrictions
6. Update user's risk profile
```
